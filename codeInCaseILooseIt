//res.json 

 .then(res=>res.json())
      .then(data=>{console.log(data)})
     

    .catch((error)=>{
      console.log(error)
    })

//it cannot read the properties of undefined, am i getting the right json
    //Tried so far:
      //http to https, with https it says fails to fetch 
      //if you do not convert response to json there is no error but it does not have the boxers data, so you cannot use.imageURL
      //instead of name typed Thomas Hearns
      //commented out the Get request for boxers 
      //played around with boxers.name, and cannot get boxerName object in script 
      // JSON.parse also used now it says failed to fetch
      //response.json(String(req.params.id)) did not work 


 <!-- try{
      stringImage = JSON.stringify(json.imageURL)
      console.log(stringImage)
      imageElement.src = stringImage

      }
      catch(e){
        console.log(e)
      } -->


Type error is due to there being a null value(solved partially)
Now I need to get image element in page
i get image link on the page but not the image

problem: why am I not seeing the id when logging image element 


I think the problem is that I am getting json and not html


what I am trying to do now is that I am trying to display the img tag which is not present on the page. 



For the longest time the code that was causing problem, i.e. image element not showing up 
was 
label 
button
option 

But now if I unselect the script it is resulting in a familiar error 


Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'onclick')
    at :name:38:20

<img
      src="<%= 'https://cataas.com//cat/P9JloQHPE4Qlrf1Q' %>"
      id="tommy"
      class="logo"
    />


even without ejs syntax I can see the image
